                    <p class="spaced-line">if you guys didn't know, stamp collecting is a hobby i find pretty interesting. in fact, i just like to learn about stamps and the stories behind them. i even have a massive stamp album at home with a bunch of stamps from india (and the rest of the world as well). so it might come as no surprise at all that this weekend i decided to go to the museum of communications (yes, i'm the type of guy that actually enjoys being in museums). anyway, let me tell you how it went.</p>
                    <p class="spaced-line">so it took me over an HOUR to get there (because, you know, bangalore traffic) but when i eventually DID get there, i looked around and the first thing i saw was a post office. literally RIGHT NEXT TO THE MUSEUM.</p>
                    <!-- CHANGED: Teal text for quotes changed to white -->

                        <strong>"makes sense... we are at the museum of COMMUNICATIONS after all"</strong>-me, when i saw the post office
                    </p><br>
                    <p class="spaced-line">anyway, the museum was pretty cool. it had a ton of cool exhibits like old postman uniforms, old telegrams from the early 1900s, those dial-up landline phones and some massive weird-looking device that was supposed to be some kind of transmitter (i don't really remember what its purpose was). unfortunately, they didn't let us take pictures inside, so i can't show you guys what the stuff looked like.</p>
                    <p class="spaced-line">but the thing that REALLY caught my eye was their large collection of stamps from around the world. and i'm not gonna lie, i was kinda jealous. they even had stamps from really obscure places, like tahiti and grenada. then i thought, "why not head into the post office next door and see if they're willing to give up some stamps?" it turns out they weren't.</p>
                    <p class="spaced-line">and that's how my day at the museum of communications went. i highly recommend you visit the museum if you're ever in the area.</p>

                        so today me and a bunch of other people from school went on a field trip to the bangalore palace! we all hopped on a bus at about 8:40 am that was gonna take us there. it took like 1 and a half hours to get there (because it's bangalore), but luckily for us, the palace only opens for visitors at 10. on the way there, we decided to have some fun. we started singing random songs at the top of our voices. but then two girls in the back sang "if you're happy and you know it, clap your hands" and that kinda ruined the vibe.

                    <p class="spaced-line">
                        when we got to the palace, we were optimistic, but i didn't really know what to expect, because quite a few of my friends, and even my class teacher, advised me against going on this trip.

                        <strong>"what are you gonna do over there, sai? there's literally nothing to do over there. it's a literal wedding venue, for god's sake"</strong>-my class teacher when she found out about me going on the trip

                        well, she and my friends may not have been completely wrong (there were a ton of wedding venues near the palace, including one within the palace complex... "palace grounds" is full of those) but i genuinely had a good time there!

                    <p class="spaced-line">
                        as we entered the place, we noticed that there was a japanese dude outside who visibly seemed to be struggling with something. then a security guard there asked me and my friends aarush and ishaan if we knew english. we said "of course" (not immediately realizing that the security guard didn't know english himself) and got to helping that japanese dude. he said "i wanna buy a ticket, can you help?" (he didn't know kannada), to which i replied "i don't think so, the school arranged our tickets." then ishaan (not knowing what to do) said "sayonara" and then walked away. well, at least the japanese bloke said "that was very good japanese." ISHAAN SAID ONE WORD. HIS ENTIRE KNOWLEDGE OF JAPANESE IS FROM THE FIRST DUOLINGO UNIT. in retrospect, i think the japanese guy was trying to be nice. but we let that slide, said our goodbyes to the man and followed ishaan into the palace.

                        anyway, there were a ton of cool exhibits there. if you've read stamps, you might know that i enjoy being in museums. there was some insanely cool stuff like a russian pool table from some bygone era, royal portraits, animal parts from the maharajas' hunting expeditions and a ton of awesome-looking paintings, including some by the legendary painter raja ravi varma. i really enjoyed looking at them. the only downside was that there was a lot of nudity in the paintings, but let's not talk about that...

                        how about we talk about the interior of the palace instead? i think it looked really beautiful. apparently it was constructed in the tudor revival style of architecture, because the erstwhile maharaja of mysore, chamarajendra wodeyar x, wanted to replicate something the british had made, like windsor castle. now i thought this was weird, because i thought most of these indian rulers were against the british, especially in mysore state, as we had seen rulers like haider ali and tipu sultan show great resistance against the british. but i was wrong. apparently after tipu's death, no ruler of mysore really cared about the british being in control. so i guess it makes sense.

                        we went to the garden after we exited the palace. in my opinion, it was pretty decent. there were some beautiful flowers and a stone fountain, but i didn't see anything too special about it. however, it served as the perfect setting for me and some of my classmates to play tag. that was fun.

                        so there was this one time where i was hanging out with my friends rohan, onion, rench and hanissh (yes, i'm pretty sure his name has the letter s twice) in lunch break at school, just casually roaming around the campus. we were just talking about random stuff when hanissh said...

                    <p class="spaced-line">
                        so then he started to run away from us. if you guys didn't realize by now, hanissh is one of the fastest guys i know. and i'm not exactly the fastest guy alive. anyway, we all instantly started chasing after him. but then he just vanished. then i thought i wouldn't stand a chance. i just turned around, gave up and started walking away. but that's when i saw rohan right behind hanissh. and they were running my way. freshly incentivized, i simply got right in front of him and tagged him. and, true to his word, he bought me a strawberry ice cream cone. it cost just 10 rupees, but was it worth it? of course it was. well i personally tend to appreciate things more when they're free.

                        sorry for the delay, guys.
                        now you might be wondering where i was all this time.
                        well... i was right here all along.

                        see, i was never really satisfied with using google sites to build my site. i mean, it looked decent... but you could tell i used a website builder to make it. the actual embeds had to be contained within blocks and that, in my opinion, really limited the website's potential. so i thought, why not just remake this site entirely using html? it seemed difficult at first... but once i had built the homepage (that surprisingly enough, took me just an hour or so), i had found motivation to carry on. over the course of many weeks, i had to juggle studying for my midterms, ACTUALLY WRITING THEM and coding this website in my spare time. but it was all worth it.
