                description: "the literary debut of nigerian author femi kayode, this novel follows philip taiwo, an investigative psychologist who travels to a remote southern town in nigeria called okriki in order to uncover the truth about the brutal murder of three university students, of which footage goes viral online. the story is based on the real life 'aluu four' lynching incident in port harcourt, nigeria, where 4 university students were set ablaze and killed on charges of theft. 'lightseekers' is a gripping novel that manages to effectively combine elements of romance and comedy with crime, and that's why i highly recommend it.",
